# sql-challenge


We have given six CSV files which consist of employees data.With these data we performed 
    
    Data Modelling
    Data Engineering
    Data Analysis
    
Sketched out Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of tables based on the csv files provided; specifying data types, primary keys and foreign keys. Exported ERD to PostgreSQL thus creating table schemas and constraints for each of the six CSV files. Imported CSV files to each corresponding SQL table.We also imported the sql database into pandas.
